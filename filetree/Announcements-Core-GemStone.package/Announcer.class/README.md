The implementation uses a threadsafe subscription registry, in the sense that registering, unregistering, and announcing from an announcer at the same time in different threads should never cause failures.

GemStone adds a "delivery error handler" to catch errors during delivery of announcements.
The default handler invokes the default action for the exception.
The ignore handler ignores the error and simply returns from the #deliver: method.
The report to GCI handler bypasses any default action and immediately returns to the GCI.
A developer can specify a customer block, as desired.
Additionally, one can specify a custom handler around the #announce: message senf and automatically revert to the previous handler afterward.
